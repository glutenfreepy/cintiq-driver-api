# cintiq-driver-api
An api for getting links to the latest wacom display driver versions.

The Wacom driver download page is scraped every morning for the links to the three latest versions for mac,
and made available here:
https://dhn1h7.deta.dev/wacom-drivers

To get link for only the latest driver:
https://dhn1h7.deta.dev/wacom-drivers/1

The links for the second and third latest drivers can be had by inserting 2 or 3 respectively in place of the 1.
